Any long-form posts for projects I've tackled. The idea here is that I write down every step of every project I try to complete at the most basic level, eventually reusing and linking to any series of steps I've posted before. This way someone wanting to try to do the project themselves will have the full instructions if they aren't familiar with any part of the setup or configuration.
